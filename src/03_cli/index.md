## Chapter 03 â€” CLI Documentation

This section covers the official CLI of Spacebin: [Comet](https://github.com/spacebin-org/comet). Since development on Comet has not yet begun, documentation on the project has not yet been written and this section is empty.

If you're looking for a CLI to use, you might look over the [Clients and Libraries](../clients_and_libraries.md) section of this wiki and try one listed there.
