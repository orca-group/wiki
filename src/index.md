> **Spacebin - Text sharing for the final frontier**

**Welcome to the official Spacebin wiki.**

This wiki contains a lot of useful information on Spacebin, all of which is listed on the Sidebar.

## What is Spacebin?

Spacebin is a modern pastebin service, built with TypeScript. It is probably the last pastebin you'll ever need.

### What is this wiki?

The goal of this wiki is to provide the most up to date and comprehensive information on Spacebin, all in one place.

It is written in Markdown by the Spacebin team, generated by mdBook and hosted on Github Pages.

### How Spacebin works

When you send a document to a Spacebin server the server generates a unique key for that document and makes the document available to any client accessing the server via the unique key.

A client can now ask the server for the document by using it's unique key. If the request is performed correctly the server will respond with the document. The client can now display the document's content.
