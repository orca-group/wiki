# The Spacebin Book

This book contains a lot of information on Spacebin, such as: Private Instance Setup, or Contributing Guides.

## Getting Started

* You probably came here looking for the Instance Setup section: You can find that [here](https://github.com/spacebin-for-astronauts/spacebin/wiki/Instance-Setup).
* This wiki houses a lot of content. You can find a list of it all at the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents).

## Community

* You can talk to our great community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hXxBtMJ).
